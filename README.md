Toolsctl
========

Toolsctl is a command line program that can be used to list and create
[Toolforge] tool accounts stored in an LDAP directory. This functionality is
provided as part of the [Striker application] for the production Toolforge
deployment. In a testing environment without Striker, this tool can be used as
an easier replacement than manual LDAP edits.
